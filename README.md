# ASA DataFest 2025 â€“ Commercial Real Estate Lease Trends Analysis

## Overview

This project was developed as part of the 2025 ASA DataFest, a nationwide data science competition hosted by the American Statistical Association. The challenge was sponsored by **Savills**, a leading international commercial real estate firm, which provided a proprietary dataset of lease transactions across major U.S. markets from 2018 to 2024.

Our primary objective was to identify **trends and micro-trends** within specific real estate submarkets to support Savills in advising clients (especially in the **Legal**, **Tech**, and **Financial Services** sectors) on **where, when, and how** to lease office space in a post-pandemic market.

Due to the proprietary nature of the data, all analysis was conducted in a secure, private environment, and we ensured compliance with all the terms and conditions outlined by ASA DataFest and Savills.

## What We Did

After carefully reviewing the provided codebook and supplementary data, our team focused on analyzing leasing behavior in the **Atlanta market**, including key cities like Atlanta, Alpharetta, Duluth, Marietta, Peachtree Corners, and Roswell.

We explored:

- Lease volume and square footage trends across time and sectors.
- Sector-specific behavior (especially Tech and Legal firms).
- Geospatial distribution of leasing hotspots.
- The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and remote work policies on leasing patterns.
- Cross-market comparisons to understand whether Atlanta followed national trends or diverged.

Our main tools were Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib), and we documented our progress in Jupyter Notebooks (`DataFest.ipynb`).

## Team Composition and Participation

Our team was originally formed with four members. However, only two of us actively participated throughout the entire event. Unfortunately, the other two members did not attend after the first day. This made it a bit of a struggle for our team during the event, but we tried our best to achieve what we could and successfully completed our presentation at the end.
